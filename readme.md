If being run, run in this order:

1. school_setup
2. populate_school
3. trigger

After this order doesn't matter.
Before running use cases make sure to run temporary_table, transaction, scheduled_even and functions



NOTE!
Also, if recreating the population data, subject and level should be a unique combination if possible, it may cause the system to not find enough possible solutions
